2014-06-01  kang  <kang@preet>

	* L5_Application\main.cpp (main): Moved RNXV example's Uart init at the main()
	* L2_Drivers\base\uart_dev.hpp: Made init() protected

2014-05-24  kang  <kang@preet>
    * L2_Drivers\src\can.c Updated tests, and made sure all API and the driver works!
    * L2_Drivers\src\can.c (CAN_gen_sid): Can controller # should be (can -1)
	* L2_Drivers\src\can.c (CAN_setup_filter): 
	       Fixed CRITICAL bug.
	       Filter WORD order was wrong, and CAN filter of standard IDs did not work.
	       CAN ISR() would enter loop
	       
	* L2_Drivers\base\uart_dev.hpp (UartDev): Made the init() method virtual.

	* L2_Drivers\src\can.c 
	   (CAN_init): Bugfix: lpc_pclk(pclk_can_flt, clkdiv_1);
	   (CAN_tx):   Added: check for CAN bus in off state:  "if(!CANx || !pCanMsg || CAN_is_bus_off(can))"
	* L5_Application\source\high_level_init.cpp (high_level_init): Delay of 5000 msec upon a crash.

    * L0_LowLevel\fault_registers.h: Added register to find out which FreeRTOS task was last running before a crash.
    * L5_Application\source\high_level_init.cpp:
        (coding standard): Changed all m_ to g_

    5)  "info" command displays time in ms or us
    6)  "cr_startup_lpx17xx.cpp" renamed to "startup.cpp"

01-01-2014 :
    1)  Project configured to use newlib-nano, yielding:
        - Nearly 50% less code
        - 80% less global RAM usage
    2)  Reduced options for SYS_CFG_REDUCED_PRINTF
    3)  str.h now has removed dependency of supporting floats

    5)  spi0.h and spi1.h renamed to ssp0.h and ssp1.h for clarity.
    6)  Added a new file "chip_info.h"
    
12-20-2013 :

    2)  Added timeout values to I2C
    3)  Updated I2C driver to make it more stable and improve error recovery
    4)  Added critical section to ADC conversion (adc.h)
    5)  In combination with new bootloader, you can now see how many times
        the CPU has been programmed.

12-02-2013 :
    1)  Updated terminal.cpp to be able to add command interface with or without echo
    2)  Enclosed ADC conversion in a critical section so it can be used from FreeRTOS task.

    2)  Removed 4th optional parameter of command handler
    3)  Returning "false" from command handler will display command's help

    7)  Added high resolution timer API at lpc_sys.h
    8)  Updated c_tlm_var.c to avoid printf warnings
    9)  Updated ff.c to latest R0.10 and modified LD_WORD(), ST_WORD() macros
        to use inline code to remove the "type punned" pointer warnings
    10) Added char_dev.hpp to provide a "char" like device to be able to printf/scanf
        and send char based data.  UART_Dev now inherits from this device and provides
        its own version of putChar() and getChar() overrides.
    11) high_level_init() prints BOARD ID that user can set ONCE in a lifetime
    12) Re-adjustd stack of all examples, and changed from printf() to either puts()
        or Uart0.printf() since printf() by itself uses a lot of stack space

    2)  Added Examples directory to L5_Application
    3)  Added malloc lock and unlock to make it safe across FreeRTOS tasks.
    4)  Removed unncessary hooks.h file
    5)  Added more documentation at tasks.hpp and added handleUserEntry() for remoteTask class.

    2) Modified command_handler.hpp
    
04-13-2013
    1) Added rit_isr.h to provide API to setup repetitive callback which also provides
        a free running timer for free.  RIT uses higher priority than FreeRTOS and if
        it sees that FreeRTOS is not running, it will set BASEPRI register to zero to
        ensure that accidental use of FreeRTOS API hasn't set the BASEPRI to non-zero
        therefore blocking our interrupts higher than IP_SYSCALL
    2) Fixed bug at uart_base.cpp for timeout without FreeRTOS.
    3) Changed uart_base.cpp such that last activity time is when a char was received
        such that when a char is sent, it is not considered as any activity.
    4) Fixed bug at uart_iface.cpp for gets()

    Added telemetry system.
    Newlib hooks added to use C FILE API, such as fopen() and fclose()
    
10-16-2012:
    Added option to optimize SPI Flash write operation
    Changed UART0 PCLK to CPU Clock instead of CPU/4 to support higher baud rates
    
10-07-2012:
    Fixed critical FreeRTOS Priority bug by adding interruptPriorities.h
    Included RTC Semaphore for FreeRTOS
    DMA for SSP1

    Added different memory schemes by configuring it at sys_config.h
    Added more functionality to storage.h
    Enabled sleep-mode configuration for temperature sensor.
    
09-16-2012:
    str needed str.printf() fixed when string couldn't be printed due to insufficient capacity.
    FATFS needed fix to get_fattime() due to change to RTC API()
