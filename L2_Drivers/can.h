/**
 * @file
 * @ingroup Drivers
 *
 * This is a simple CAN driver that optionally utilizes the FullCAN capability.
 * FullCAN is hardware filtering of the CAN messages and the configured messages
 * are stored directly into the CAN RAM (separate 2K RAM) without CPU intervention.
 *
 * FullCAN feature summary :
 *      - Messages go straight into dedicated RAM, SW never needs to be interrupted
 *      - Each FullCAN entry can generate an interrupt (up to 64 messages)
 *      - FullCAN entry can only be 11-bit NOT 29-bit type.
 *      - Note that FullCAN is for BOTH CANs.  If you wish to have separate message reads
 *        of individual CANs, you can enable non FullCAN filters because the implementation
 *        provides queues of separate CAN channels.
 *
 * When the CAN bus is initialized, we initially configure it to not accept any messages
 * until filtering or bypass option is used.  For the filtering, in addition to the FullCAN,
 * you can configure explicit 11-bit and 29-bit IDs (including groups) and only these
 * messages will be accepted.
 *
 * Note that if you send a message, and no other node acknowledges the message sent,
 * then the CAN BUS may enter "Bus off" state due to error(s).  You must correct
 * this situation and reset the CAN BUS.
